#### Data simulation is based on the article:
Torrijos-Nino et al.(2014). Physical fitness, obesity and academic achievement in Schoolchildren.The Journal of Pediatrics. Vol.165.No.1

#### Background:
Children with higher physical activity levels have also higher fitness levels. Physical activity related neurophysiological changes in the brain have been hypothesized to explain the positive influence of physical fitness on academic performance such as that the physical activity increases blood flow, improves neuroelectric functionality and stimulates the release of brain- derived neurotropic factor that facilitates learning and maintains cognitive functions by improving synaptic plasticity.
        Lots of studies have been done to find the association between the physical fitness and academic achievement, however most of them have found weak relationship due to the lack of potential confounders such as parental education
and demographic variables.This article specifically controlled BMI, parental education and age of the schoolkids participating in
this study. Physical fitness measurements test such as cardio respiratory fitness, muscle strength, speed, agility and coordin
ation were conducted and independent ability of each of these test on the academic achievement was tested.Academic achievement was calculated using the mean of scores in four different courses for the exam from the previous year-Mathematics, language and literature, natural, social and cultural sciences, foreign language.They found out that cardio respiratory fitness and speed agility were associated with higher academic achievement. Cardio respiratory fitness was found in boys and higher speed, agility and coordination in girls.

#### Data Simulation:
The dataset is simulated using the findings from the above article. Among, 893 schoolchildren 51% were girls and 49% boys.All the variables used in this study were continous and normally distributed.

###### Features used:
a. CRF-Cardio-respiratory fitness measured by shuttle run test (seconds)
b. HG-Handgrip (kg)
c. SG-Standing broad jump ( cm)
d. MF-Muscular Fitness index
e. SA-Speed/Agility/Coordination ( seconds)
CRF,SA,HG and SG are gender,age and weight specific test.However, they controlled age and BMI for this study so these variables were simulated based on the gender. Muscular fitness index was calculated using the standzardized z-scores of handgrip and standing broad jump test. 

Outcome:Academic achievement( mean of scores)

From the boxplots and scatterplots, we can see that the CRF and SA are higher for boys and girls respectively.The higher academic scores are associated with higher range of CRF and SA.From the density plots we can see that,school boys seem to have higher Muscular fitness indesx and cardio respiratory fitness than girls. Girls have higher speed, agility and coordination for this study.

```
Linear regression model was done to predict the academic achievement ( mean of scores ). Model summary shows that the CRF (Cardio respiratory fitness) ,SA( Speed agility and Coordination)  and gender seem to be the significant variables  just like  it was found from the study. Muscular fitness index seem to be not the significant variable just like they found in the paper.  R^2 of 0.87 shows the goodness of fit and p value is less than 0.05 which shows that this model is significant.
